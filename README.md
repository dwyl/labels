# üè∑ Labels

See it in action: https://label-sync.herokuapp.com/

## What?

Gui application to copy labels from one repo to another.

## Why?

Having a standard list of labels across all of your projects means that you can
move between repositories quickly and effectively. *However*, manually adding
labels to a new GitHub repository can become old, ***fast***. This module aims
to **save you time** by automating the addition of labels to a new project by
copying them from a selected repo and then transferring them to a target repo.

Our main criteria is that it ***MUST*** be quicker than manually adding labels and will offer a [hosted version](https://label-sync.herokuapp.com/) of the app if you don't want to configure/run the app yourself.

At dwyl we intensively use labels on issues and pull requests to communicate about the status of the work for each team member of our project.
We are working remotely and the labels allow us to quickly know who took responsibilities on an issue and what progress they are at. For example we can quickly now from the list of issues on a repository if someone is working on a specific issue (`in-progress` label), if an issue is finished but waiting for review (`in-review` label) or if an issue is currently reviewed (`in-review` label), see the [list of labels and their description](https://github.com/dwyl/labels#labels).

This process really allows us to speed up some projects and let us focus on developing features instead of spending time on Gitter/Slack explaining the status of an issue. It allows also to communicate quickly with our clients as they know when to tests and approve/reject a feature with the label `please-test`.

## Who?

Any Github user who has created multiple repositories and values their time ‚è∞

## How?
A simple and intuitive UI authenticated with GitHub using [hapi-auth-github](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github) and make requests to the github api on your behalf.

After authentication via github login a user will simply have to submit a form with the following fields.
 + Source repo name and owner
 + Target repo name and owner

### What happens to existing labels in target repo?
Labels is _non-destructive_.  
If there are existing labels with the same name but a different colour,
the colour will change to match the source repo.  
Other than this, it will simply add any labels that don't already exist and
won't touch the existing ones.

## Run

#### Config

Since we are using [hapi-auth-github](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github) you will need to follow some of their setup to run the project locally.
 + You need to create a new oauth application in your github but please see [hapi-auth-github](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github#2-create-an-app-on-github) for details.
 + You will need to create a [.env](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables) file root or project of the form:
```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=see_hapi-auth-github
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=see_hapi-auth-github
BASE_URL=see_hapi-auth-github
JWT_SECRET=see_hapi-auth-github
PORT=see_hapi-auth-github
GITHUB_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL=see_hapi-auth-github
SOURCE_REPO=optional
SOURCE_OWNER=optional
```
As we use  we will need all the environment variables [required](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-github#3-export-the-required-environment-variables) for that module plus our own optional:
  + `SOURCE_REPO` defaults the value of the source repo in form.
  + `SOURCE_OWNER`defaults the value of the source owner in form.


#### To run:

Enter these commands into your terminal:
* `git clone https://github.com/dwyl/labels.git`
* `cd labels`
* `npm i`
* :arrow_up: Make sure you have your `.env` file and all the required variables :arrow_up:.
* `npm start`
* Visit http://localhost:8000/ (or port you have selected)


## Labels

This repository contains our 'master list' of labels used across all dwyl projects: http://www.github.com/dwyl/labels/labels

An explanation of each can be found below, starting with the custom dwyl labels, which we use in conjunction with our [contributing process/guidelines](http://www.github.com/dwyl/contributing).

Clicking on a label will take you to an issue with further discussion on its existence and meaning:

- [`awaiting-review`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/49) #f39c12 - added to _issue_ once a PR with its resolution has been assigned to a reviewer (replaces `in-progress`)
- [`chore`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/37) #3A2716 - routine tasks that must be done for every project but require little active brain power
- [`discuss`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/8) #60EEEE - invites discussion from contributors
- [`epic`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/35) #000059 - big issues that span multiple days & need to be broken down
- [`external-dependency`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/54) #e6e6e6 - no further work can be carried out until a third party completes an action (specified in a comment in the issue)
- `in-progress` #009688 - added when you *start* working on an issue (and have assigned it to yourself)
- [`in-review`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/48) #128A0C - added to _PR_ by QA/reviewer to show a review is *in progress*
- [`merge-conflicts`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/26) #E74C3C - added to a _PR_ when it has merge conflicts that need to be fixed by the PR's creator
- [`please-test`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/46) #08E700 - added after PR is merged *and* the feature/fix/change has been deployed to *somewhere the Product Owner can actually **test** it* (assign issue to PO)
- `priority-1` #0D47A1 - drop everything and work on this (used only when _completely_ necessary)
- `priority-2` #1976D2 - high priority issue (what needs doing now)
- `priority-3` #42A5F5 - high priority (what needs doing next)
- `priority-4` #8DC9F9 - low priority (to be upgraded later)
- `priority-5` #C5DEF5 - lowest priority (non-urgent changes and backlog ideas)
- `research` #82f2d6 - additional research required to make progress on a story/task. Be specific in the issue description/comment.
- [`starter`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/36) #27AE60 - issues that those with not much coding experience can contribute to
- [`T[x]d`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/41) #F06292 - estimated time in 'x' days the issue will take to resolve
- [`T[x]h`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/41) #F7C6C7 - estimated time in 'x' hours the issue will take to resolve
- `technical` #D4C5F9 - technical tasks e.g. deployment
- [`user-feedback`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/61) #E91E63 - requests or features that have been added to the backlog as a direct result of user testing
- [`va-task`](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/50) #128214 -
denotes administrative tasks that can be done by 'Virtual Assistants',
usually for [non-developers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Virtual-Freedom-Chris-C-Ducker/dp/1939529743)

Github also gives you a pre-populated list of labels with every repo:

- `bug` #EE0701 - report a [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug), not to be confused with a request for additional changes to the code
- `duplicate` #CCCCCC - duplicate issue (link to duplicate in comments)
- `enhancement` #84B6EB - improving existing code
- `help-wanted` #128A0C - signals author of the issue is looking for help or expertise on a subject
_(NB. if you'd like to see where dwyl is in need of a helping hand, check out https://tudo-app.herokuapp.com/)_
- `invalid` #E6E6E6 - issue is not valid (not used in dwyl)
- `question` #CC317C - for open questions
- `wontfix` #ffffff - when an issue won't be addressed (add a comment to the issue as to *why* this is the case


## Questions/Suggestions

We hope you find the application useful! We really want to make the process of setting up a repo as fast as possible so hope this helps.

If you need something cleared up, have any requests or want to offer any improvements then please [create an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/new).

 **Note** It also would be great to hear, via issue, your thoughts on our existing set of labels plus your own favourites :smiley:
